# Sui-DAT - Resume Bullet Points

## Project: Sui-DAT (Decentralized AI Training Platform)
**Role**: Full-Stack Developer | **Duration**: [Add dates] | **Tech Stack**: Next.js, TypeScript, FastAPI, Python, MongoDB, Sui Blockchain, Walrus Storage

### Bullet Points (Choose 3-5 based on resume space):

1. **Architected and developed a full-stack decentralized AI training platform** using Next.js 16, TypeScript, and FastAPI, enabling distributed machine learning across multiple participants' computers instead of centralized data centers

2. **Integrated Sui blockchain and Walrus decentralized storage** to create transparent, verifiable training records with on-chain metadata storage and CID-based immutable data references

3. **Implemented real-time training monitoring system** with background task processing, WebSocket-like polling, and live progress visualization using React Flow and Recharts for metrics tracking

4. **Built comprehensive RESTful API** with FastAPI featuring training session management (start/pause/resume/stop), dataset validation, gradient aggregation, and MongoDB persistence for scalable concurrent operations

5. **Developed responsive web dashboard** with modern UI/UX using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI, featuring interactive workflow visualization, real-time analytics charts, and Sui wallet integration for blockchain transactions

6. **Designed microservices architecture** supporting multiple concurrent training sessions with async/await patterns, error handling, and fallback mechanisms for reliable decentralized storage operations

7. **Created contributor reputation and reward system** with smart contract integration, leaderboard tracking, and automated reward distribution based on training contributions

8. **Implemented multi-format dataset management** with automatic validation, quality scoring, and Walrus storage integration supporting CSV, JSON, and text file formats
